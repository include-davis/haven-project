			<p>The Haven Project is a club originally designed at Notre Dame High School by Erin Miller and Izzie Ramirez in 2019 with a goal to create a safe space for children in foster care. It began with 10 members and has since then grown to become not only a club with over 100 members, but also has grown to have a branch at UC Davis as well. As a club we strive to not only provide resources for children going through this process but also educate ourselves and peers on a topic that is so often overlooked. As a club we have been able to do many projects from Boxes of Love (quarantine care packages), to creating a Buddy the Bear mascot as a friend to children who may feel lonely, to launching our merchandise, spreading awareness to donors nationwide. Even with the difficulties of COVID and pivoting to online meetings and projects, we have been able to support over 40 children in the Los Angeles area. We are thrilled to continue our outreach as the Haven Project expands and we are able to provide love and support for children all over the world.</p>

  			<p>The Haven Project at UCD was started in the fall quarter of 2020. Though we have struggled through 2020 and Ms. Corona being who she is, we believed that the youths in foster care would need their communityâ€™s support even more. For as much as we struggled, they would even more so. We are so blessed to be a place that attracts so many UCD students who are so passionate and willing to donate their time and efforts to our cause. We initially started with six members and it quickly grew to the members we have today. We will continue to work to support the youths of all ages in and out of foster care through our projects: The Giving Tree, The Boxes of Love, The Pen Pal Program, and many more to come. </p>

			<p>The Haven Project was originally founded at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California in 2019. This branch originally started with approximately 10 members and we have now grown to over 100 members. We have done projects throughout the past 2 years, to provide love, support, and goodies to these children and have been able to support over 40 children so far, with hopes of expanding our outreach. We have done many projects and have many planned projects such as the boxes of love (quarantine care packages), the pen pal project, and much more. We are hoping that we use these goodies to support each child we work with. We have been fortunate enough to work with other clubs at Notre Dame to join together and further spread our love and support.</p>
