        The Haven Project at UCD was started in the fall quarter of 2020. 
        Though we have struggled through 2020 and Ms. Corona being who she is, 
        we believed that the youths in foster care would need their community’s 
        support even more. For as much as we struggled, they would even more so. 
        
        <br>

        <br>
        
        We are so blessed to be a place that attracts so many UCD students who 
        are so passionate and willing to donate their time and efforts to our 
        cause. We initially started with six members and it quickly grew to the 
        members we have today. We will continue to work to support the youths 
        of all ages in and out of foster care through our projects: The Giving 
        Tree, The Boxes of Love, The Pen Pal Program, and many more to come.
